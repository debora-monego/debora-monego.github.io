                <h2>Coevolution and Mechanical Function in Collagen</h2>
                <p>Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in the extracellular matrix and is essential for tissue
                    structure and function. Its unique triple-helical structure is key to the mechanical properties of
                    different tissues, from the elasticity of skin to the strength of bones. In our research, we explore
                    the evolutionary history of collagen, focusing on how natural selection has shaped its amino acid
                    sequence to adapt to mechanical forces.</p>
                <p>Using advanced bioinformatics tools like Direct Coupling Analysis, we identify <strong>coevolved
                        residue pairs</strong> within collagen sequences. This approach allows us to examine collagen
                    across a range of species and tissue types, uncovering patterns of evolution that have remained
                    consistent or changed over time. We pay special attention to residues that interact between triple
                    helices, those involved in crosslinking, and amino acids with potential redox activity. This
                    analysis gives us a deeper understanding of how intra- and inter-chain interactions contribute to
                    collagen’s unique mechanical properties.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to develop a <strong>predictive model</strong> that links collagen’s <strong>evolutionary
                        markers</strong> to its <strong>mechanical behavior</strong>. Such a model would not only
                    enhance our understanding of collagen’s role in tissue mechanics but could also inform biomaterial
                    design and advance our knowledge of collagen-related disorders.</p>

                <h2>Metal Ions and DOPA in Collagen Crosslinking</h2>
                <p>Collagen's covalent crosslinks have been a focus of research for years, but there's still much to
                    learn about this complex protein. We're exploring a less-studied aspect: the potential role of
                    <strong>metal-coordinated crosslinks</strong>. We're especially intrigued by crosslinks involving
                    <strong>DOPA</strong> (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) residues.
                </p>
                <p>Our interest in this area was sparked by the fascinating properties of mussel byssus threads. These
                    tough, elastic fibers use DOPA-Fe³⁺ coordination crosslinks to achieve their remarkable strength. We
                    hypothesize that similar mechanisms might exist in collagen, potentially contributing to its
                    mechanical properties.</p>
                <p>To investigate this hypothesis, we employ a combination of computational and experimental methods.
                    Our approach includes simulations to model the formation and behavior of these crosslinks at the
                    molecular level and measurements to detect and characterize these metal-coordinated structures in
                    collagen samples.</p>
                <p>Our research aims to elucidate how these metal-coordinated crosslinks might influence collagen's
                    mechanical properties, particularly its ability to <strong>withstand stress</strong> and potentially
                    <strong>self-heal</strong>. Understanding these mechanisms could provide new insights into
                    collagen's structure-function relationships and inform the development of biomaterials with enhanced
                    mechanical properties.

                <h2>Force Propagation in Collagen</h2>
                <p>Understanding how mechanical forces propagate through collagen's complex structure is crucial for
                    predicting its behavior under stress. Our research focuses on developing and refining
                    <strong>full-atom models of collagen</strong>, integrating insights from our studies on collagen
                    evolution and crosslinking mechanisms.
                </p>
                <p>With these computational models, we can explore how different parts of collagen's structure affect
                    <strong>how force spreads through it</strong>. We're looking at things like where crosslinks are
                    located, how the triple helix is shaped, and how hydrogen bonds are arranged.
                </p>
                <p>A key challenge in collagen research is bridging the gap between molecular-level interactions and
                    macroscale mechanical properties. Our work aims to address this by developing more accurate
                    predictive models of collagen behavior under various mechanical conditions.</p>
