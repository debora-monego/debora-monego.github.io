        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="blog-section">
            <p>Collagen is a unique triple-helical protein that plays a crucial role in providing structural integrity
                to various tissues. In this post, we'll explore the fascinating structure of collagen, its function, and
                how it can inspire biomaterial design.</p>

        <!-- Section 1: The Structure of Collagen -->
        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2>1. The Triple-Helix Structure</h2>
            <p>Collagen has a distinctive triple-helix structure formed by three polypeptide chains. These chains are
                rich in the amino acids glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, which contribute to the stability and
                rigidity of the helix. This unique structure allows collagen to be strong and flexible.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Collagen in Tissues -->
        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2>2. Collagen in Biological Tissues</h2>
            <p>Collagen is found in many different tissues, including skin, tendons, cartilage, and bones. Its fibrous
                nature allows it to resist stretching and provide support to cells and tissues. This section delves
                deeper into its biological role and the implications for tissue mechanics.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Implications for Biomaterials -->
        <section class="blog-section">
            <h2>3. Applications in Biomaterials</h2>
            <p>The unique properties of collagen have inspired the development of biomaterials that mimic its mechanical
                and structural qualities. This has implications for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and the
                design of new materials with enhanced mechanical properties.</p>
